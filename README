This package provides tools to manage requests to a remote process server using
the Web Processing Service standard [1]. The outputs of these requests are
fetched and published to a local map service, assuming they are of a spatial
character when complex. The map service used is MapServer [2].
Parts of this code are inspired on the PyWPS [3] project, whose developers had
a relevant role in some of the solutions here coded.

WPS CLIENT is part of the integrated Geospatial Urban Energy Information & 
Support System (iGUESS) [4] and a product of the MUSIC project [5], developed 
by the Centre de Recherche Publique Henri Tudor in Luxembourg [6].

This code is released under the EUPL v1.1 open source licence [7], please read
